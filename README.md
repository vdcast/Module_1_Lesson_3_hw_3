# Module_1_Lesson_3_hw_3
**Lesson's topic:**

Loops, working with arrays.

**Technical task:**

Write a data parser. The task is taken from a real project.
You receive data from an external device in the string format:
<voltage=220,power=3200,speed=0,silent_mode=0>. This is data about the current state of a device: voltage, power, speed, and whether it works in quiet mode or not.
It is necessary to write a program that would find the values of all 4 parameters in this line and write them to the corresponding variables. Attention! Some parameter may not come, for example <voltage=220,power=3200>.
